# Memory Model
This is a project for the class "Data Structures and Algorithm Implementation." This project is a simulation as to how memory works. This model assumed a 2 cycle L1 acess, 5 cycle L2 acess, 10 cycle L3 acess, and 100 cycle Main Memory (MM) acess. The simulation works by the user pre-inititalizing the location (L1, L2, L3, or MM) of a data element, and then specifying what time the request should come in. This is done in the 'test_mm.cpp' file. Then simulation returns text to the terminal in the form of a summary with what happens at each cycle. The possible choices of what happens are: Requests, Hits (sucessfuly found data), and Misses (did not find data). To view a sample terminal output, navigate to the 'test' repository.
