# XML Parser
This is a project for the class "Data Structures and Algorithm Implemenation." The task was to develop a parser for the XML language, and develop tests for the parser.

NOTE: I did not code the Bag.cpp and Bag.hpp files (Bag ADT), it was gotten from the textbook for this class
      - The catch framework (Catch.hpp) was also given
      
      This project was compiled using cmake, and made for Linux/macOS machines
